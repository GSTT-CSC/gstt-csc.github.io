</div>

The CSC Team develops software applications for routine clinical usage. This includes Software as a 
Medical Device (SaMD). The development of medical software requires extra safety considerations above 
normal software development, particularly around clinical and patient safety, data security, usability, and managing changes.  

The CSC Team provides both software and clinical expertise across a broad range of hospital settings. We are embedded 
within Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, which gives us direct access to clinical databases including PACS, 
CRIS and EPR.

## The Software Building Process

<h3 style="color: #D7472E">The CSC Quality Management System</h3>

The CSC team develops medical software within a quality management system (QMS) that is ISO 13485:2016 compliant. 

The scope of our ISO 13485 certificate is as follows: 

_The design and manufacture of software medical devices that use machine learning to perform inference on images for the
purpose of diagnosis. The design and manufacture of software medical devices that use machine learning to perform
inference on non-image-based data._

_All devices will only be used within the Guys & St Thomas’s NHS Foundation Trust._

_The scope of this certificate is limited to the quality management system and does not make any claims about the 
conformity of the products generated by the quality management system to regulatory requirements._

We have gained ISO13485:2016 certification for our QMS from the UK Certification body [Scarlet](https://www.ukas.com/wp-content/uploads/schedule_uploads/1001534/23422Management-Systems.pdf) in 2022.

<br>
The QMS sits within the GSTT Medical Physics Department and utilises key departmental processes and resources for audits, 
management review, HR, and purchasing. It incorporates all aspects of the standards and regulations listed on the page 
below, as relevant to the scope. 

The following software and packages are validated for use for projects under this QMS:
  - XNAT
  - MONAI
  - MLOps
