The CSC Team develops software applications for routine clinical usage. This includes Software as a 
Medical Device (SaMD). It is well understood that building medical software requires extra safety considerations above 
normal software development.

Our team comprises both software and clinical expertise across a broad range of hospital settings. We are embedded 
within Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, which gives us direct access to clinical databases including PACS, 
CRIS and EPR.
