All new members of the CSC team will complete a Trust Corporate Induction, including any upfront training required for their role and primary work site. Each member will be provided with a GSTT account and corresponding GSTT email address e.g., FirstName.LastName@gstt.nhs.uk. This will give you access to the Trust's intranet and services, including the Human Resources (HR) Portal, IT ServiceNow Portal (for IT support), and TrustOLE for completing mandatory training and educational courses.

#### Remote Working

The CSC team generally work both remotely within the UK and on-site, with the proportion of time spent in each subject to the nature of work, individual member responsibilities, and Line Manager approval. Generally, in-person attendance at the fortnightly 10x workshops is required but team members may join remotely if necessary.

Remote working overseas, however, is not permitted by the Trust due various tax and legal requirements. 

#### Annual Leave

As per Trust policy, requests for annual leave, as well as other forms of leave, should be raised with your Line Manager for approval.

The annual leave balance is renewed in April, and there are certain periods within the UK fiscal year in which you can sell/buy annual leave (see HR Portal for more information) subject to approval. However, if you find you expect to have a remaining unused annual leave balance and do not wish to sell these days, this is typically approved to be carried over into the next fiscal year if it is 5 days or less, whereas more than 5 days will require Line Manager approval. In either case, we recommend you speak to your Line Manager as soon as possible to request formal approval and discuss leave scheduling.

#### PDRs

Members of the CSC Team undergo a yearly Performance Development Review (PDR) with their Line Manager, as well as a follow-up mid-year review. This is an opportunity for members of the team to set personal development goals and objectives, reflect on their ongoing progress, and highlight any outstanding areas where additional education and/or support may be required. It is also an opportunity to discuss your career progression, health, and well-being concerns or changes in working hours.

For more information on the PDR process, please refer to the Trust HR Portal.
