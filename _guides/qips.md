⚠️ **Before proceeding with the following steps**, please ensure:
1. Your project falls under "Service Development" and **not** "Research", e.g. via [this decision tool](https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/).
2. The Clinical Lead is happy to be added as a collaborator on the QIPS system.

All artificial intelligence (AI) projects must be registered with the Trust Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Team as a service evaluation/clinical audit on the Trust database [here](http://tww-wafr/WAFR-FAD/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=/WAFR-FAD/Applications/ClinicalAuditV2/Default.aspx ).

1. Log into  with your Trust credentials.
2. Select **_Create New Proposal_** tab. 
3. Select **Service Evaluation** as the **_Proposal Type_**. 
4. Enter **Project Title** as agreed with the radiologist(s). 
5. Add the **Clinical Lead** as the **_Proposer_**.  
6. Add your telephone number. 
7. Select **No** in response to the question **_Is proposal trust wide?_** 
8. Select **Medical Physics** as the **_Lead Speciality_**. 
9. Enter your name as the **_Responsible Person_**. 
10. Select **High risk service**, **Of local concern**, **Identified as a problem**, and/or **Quality improvement**, and any other selections that may apply as **_Reasons for carrying out this project_**.

12. Briefly explain what you are trying to achieve with this project in response to the **_Objective_** section. 
13. Click on **Save** and then press **Next**.
14. Enter **Radiologists** as the **_Stakeholder_**. 
    - Select all activities they will be involved with and press the green plus button. 
15. If the project does not involve patients or carers, select **No**, otherwise select **Yes**. 
16. Describe who will be included, e.g. ‘all chest CT’, and who will be excluded (if any) as the **Population**. 
    - As part of this **Population or Sample**, select all applicable fields and choose to gather data from 1/1 of last year to 31/1 of last year. 
    - Select data collection strategy (e.g. retrospective) and the data sources (e.g. patient records). 
17. Click on **Save** and then press **Next**.
18. Click on **Add measures**. A pop-up will appear.  
19. Set the standard or acceptable level of compliance (frequently '100%' but write whatever is appropriate for your project).
20. Describe the evidence of quality of care or service, i.e. how will we know whether the AI is working?, etc. For example, "lung nodule in chest CT is correctly reported in report". 
21. Select **No** as **_Exception_**. 
22. Describe how data will be acquired, e.g. "studies to be exported from PACS and processed offline", as **_Data collection instructions_**. 
23. Click on **Add measures**. 
24. Fill in the target dates, e.g. for data collection (1 month from start), findings to be reviewed by 3 months from the data collection date, and report to be submitted 3 months from the findings date. 
25. Click on **Save** and then press **Next**.
26. Select all applicable boxes (this is likely to be all of them). 
27. Click on **Next**.
28. Agree with the declaration by ticking the box, click on **Next** and then press **Submit**. 

The proposal will be sent to the Specialty Quality Improvement (QI) & Audit lead for approval and then to the Directorate QI & Audit lead.
Once approved, you will be notified by email.
