# Room Booking

- Becket House has an online booking system and you will need to request access using your KCL email.
You can do this here: [room booking system](https://www.isd.kcl.ac.uk/internal/roombooking/login.php).

- If you do not have an account, you can request one on the link above. It takes a day or so to be granted access.

Once logged in with your credentials:

1. click on 'Room Booking and Equipment booking'
2. find the room you need from the drop-down menu
3. put in your date and then click on 'visual search' - this will show the whole calendar
4. Find the slot you need
5. If it is free, click on the link in that slot - it will take you back to the form.
6. Write in your reason for the room booking - this will later be visible to all users in the visual search.
7. Click 'insert' and confirm you wish to proceed with the booking. 
8. Re-run the visual search to confirm your booking has been successful. 

You can now close the website.

#### Visitors

If you've invited colleagues who do not usually have access to BH, you will need to collect them from the reception. 
Each daily visitor and contractors must do the online BH training available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=g5k9SjbpN0iVUp2RJqkusKnSgjC8bPJBr_4Ws8XbUAlUOUtDNEU3SFhPT1JURllMSVFUSTdXTEQ4Uy4u). 
It's handy if they can fill it in in advance else they'll have to do it when they arrive.
