<b>Clinical lead</b>: Davina Mak <br>

<b>Rationale</b><br>
Osteoporosis is easily treatable if identified, but can lead to complex fractures at other sites if undiagnosed, especially in the hip where a > 50% mortality at 12 months over the age of 80. Currently, 70% of vertebral compression fractures are undiagnosed though they are the most common osteoporotic fracture. This project would work in conjunction with the current fracture liaison service quality improvement project. 

77% of scans with vertebral compression fractures are correctly identified and 43% scans recommend referrals – both of these numbers can be improved with AI tools.<br>

<b>Patient pathway</b><br> Incidental findings, patients present for imaging for other reasons<br>

<b>Training data</b><br> Clinical datasets are available (CT, MRI, x-rays). Imaging usually performed for other indications.<br>

<b>Errors</b><br> A timely identification of vertebral compression fractures which indicate osteoporosis allows the clinicians to refer the patient for osteoporosis treatment. If the osteoporosis signs are missed and the patient sustains a fracture, the fracture is complex and carries a high rate of mortality in older patients<br>

<b>Goals</b><br> Increased rates of identification and treatment referrals after identification to reduce occurrence of complex fractures in other sites.<br>

<b>Success Criteria</b><br> Increased referrals and identifications of vertebral compression fractures<br>

<b>Alternatives</b><br> <a href="https://www.zebra-med.com/bone-health-solution"> NanoxAI</a>. Retrospective and prospective trials are planned to take place in the early 2022. The results will determine whether this clinical problem will be solved with NanoxAI's BoneHealth solution<br>

<b> Status update</b>

In 2021 we engaged with a company to test out their product but due to difficulties beyond our control the evaluation did not commence at that time.

As an alternative, we will proceed with an in-house solution which will begin development in autumn 2024. Until then, this 
project cannot be prioritised and will sit in the backlog.
